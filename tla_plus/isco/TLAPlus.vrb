    \begin{itemize}
        \item We have several nodes (lets say nodes are 1, 2 and 3)
        \item Every node can reboot and recover later on
        \item Every node has one instance of service
        \item When node is down, its service instance gets transferred to another node which is up to serve additional traffic
        \item When we detect that service instance is stuck, we kill it and restart it
        \item We state that eventually if service is stuck, this will lead to either it being killed or recovered by itself
    \end{itemize}
